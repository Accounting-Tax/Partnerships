# Partnerships 2024

## Overview
A partnership is defined under tax law as "an association of persons carrying on a business as partners or in receipt of ordinary income or statutory income jointly, but does not include a company." For tax purposes, the existence of a partnership is determined based on the facts relevant to each case. A formal partnership agreement is not required for tax purposes.

## Creation of Partnership
Evidence of a partnership may include joint ownership of business assets, joint bank accounts, shared profits/losses, and public recognition of the business as a partnership. Partnerships can be used for income splitting, reducing the overall tax liability of family members.

## Taxation of a Partnership
A partnership does not pay income tax itself but must lodge a Partnership tax return (Form P). If partners only derive rent, interest, or dividends jointly, a partnership return is not necessary. Each partner is individually taxed on their share of partnership net income (PNI), and losses are deducted in the partner's personal income tax return.

## Partnership Net Income (PNI)
PNI is defined by s.90 ITAA36 as the balance after deducting allowable deductions and losses from assessable income. PNI is divided according to the partnersâ€™ profit/loss sharing ratio. Payments such as salaries or interest to partners are not deductions for the partnership, while interest from loans by partners to the partnership are.

## Dividend Imputation
If a partnership receives franked dividends, the income is "grossed up" to include the franking credit, and the franking credit is apportioned between the partners.

## Partnership Losses
A partnership cannot carry forward losses. Losses are distributed to the partners in the year incurred.

## Partnership Capital Gains/Losses
Capital gains and losses are not included in PNI; individual partners are assessed on their share of any gains or losses.

## Miscellaneous Matters
- **No Deduction Allowed**: Superannuation contributions and life insurance premiums for partners are not deductible by the partnership but are instead deductions for the individual partners.
- **Payments to Relatives and Associated Persons**: The ATO has discretion to allow only reasonable deductions for payments made to relatives, associated persons, or related entities.

## Uncontrolled Partnership Income (UPI)
UPI provisions (s.94 ITAA36) are designed to prevent tax avoidance. UPI applies when a partner does not have real and effective control over their share of PNI. Partners who are minors are exempt from UPI.

## Structural Changes to Partnerships
- **Trading Stock**: A change in partnership ownership is treated as a notional disposal of stock, and any profit or loss is assessable to the old owners unless an election is made to use the stock value without disposal.
- **Depreciable Assets**: When there is a change in ownership, adjustments may be required under balancing adjustment rules if at least one partner has an interest before and after the change.
